# LETO 

SPOO leto is a minimalistic css framework and design system, built for uncluttered and structured user interfaces.

## Getting started

Include the spoo leto css file:

`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="path/to/leto.css">`

The general wrapper class 'leto-frame', must be used as the root element.

</body>
```
